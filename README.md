# ANNA
ANNA(Asadullah's Neural Network Architecture) is our new experimental architecture which we actively develop.
It's supposed to be a more efficient alternative to the Transformers architecture for roleplaying, story-telling and similar tasks which don't require the amount of performance as the average Transformer model offers.
Currently, it's simply an implementation of a MLP(Multi-Layer-Perceptron) with thread support through OMP.

# Getting started
Ensure you have `git` and `g++` installed on the device you want to run following commands on.
First,
```
git clone https://github.com/XeTute/ANNA
cd ANNA
```
then, on Linux:
```
g++ -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0 -O3 -Ofast -march=native -mtune=native -flto -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -ffast-math -fopenmp -fwhole-program -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -fexceptions main.cpp ANNA.hpp -o anna
chmod +x anna
./anna
```
or, if you're on Windows, there are two options.
The first one is to use G++(MinGW) like on Linux. This is not recommended, as it is significantly slower. We added all optimisation flags on both Linux and Windows, but compared to MVSC for C++, the executeable generated by MinGW will always be much slower than MVSC's generated executeable.
```
g++ -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0 -O3 -Ofast -march=native -mtune=native -flto -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -ffast-math -fopenmp -fwhole-program -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -fexceptions main.cpp ANNA.hpp -o anna.exe
./anna.exe
```
The second option, as you may have guessed it, is to use the MVSC C++ compiler, which will always be much faster on Windows.<br>
This will download, compile and execute the latest main.cpp found on this GitHub repo.
