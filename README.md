# ANNA
ANNA is short for Asadullah's Neural Network Architecture. This is an implementation of ANNA, therefore we named this repo and the library "ANNA" too.<br>
The naming can be confusing, but once you get it, you'll navigate around easily.

# What this repo is
This repo is a headers-only library which does not require any dependencies for CPU, and OpenCL for GPU usage.<br>
We originally wanted to implement only CPU and CUDA, but Intel's latest GPUs are pretty good for consumer-AI-tasks, and OpenCL runs on not only GPUs, so it's simply way smarter.<br>

# Language
ANNA is a native C++, headers-only library. We're not currently planning to port it to languages like Python or Java.

# Learn how to use ANNA
You can read the Wiki on this repo, but it's not updated pretty often. It's a great doc though.<br>
But, listen, we're doing our bestâ€”We're currently scripting some tutorial and Wiki pages on our webpage(s) xetute.github.io, which is more reliable than our Apex domain xetute.com.

# Happy coding!
